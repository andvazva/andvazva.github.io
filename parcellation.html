								<p style="text-align: justify;">We present a hybrid method to create fine-grained parcellations of the cortical surface, 
									from a coarse-grained parcellation according to an anatomical atlas, based on cortico-cortical connectivity. The connectivity 
									information is obtained from segmented superficial and deep white matter bundles, according to bundle atlases, instead of the whole tractography.
									 Thus, a direct matching between the fiber bundles and the cortical regions is obtained, avoiding the problem of finding the correspondence of the 
									 cortical parcels among subjects. Generating parcels from segmented fiber bundles can provide a good representation of the human brain connectome 
									 since they are based on bundle atlases that contain the most reproducible short and long connections found on a population of subjects. The method 
									 first processes the tractography of each subject and extracts the bundles of the atlas, based on a segmentation algorithm. Next, the intersection 
									 between the fiber bundles and the cortical mesh is calculated, to define the initial and final intersection points of each fiber. A fiber filtering
									  is then applied to eliminate misclassified fibers, based on the anatomical definition of each bundle and the labels of Desikan-Killiany anatomical
									   parcellation. A parcellation algorithm is then performed to create a subdivision of the anatomical regions of the cortex, which is reproducible 
									   across subjects. This step resolves the overlapping of the fiber bundle extremities over the cortical mesh within each anatomical region. For the 
									   analysis, the density of the connections and the degree of overlapping, is considered and represented with a graph. ></p>
